          Digital Product Managment
        </h3>
        <p>
          Over the past several years I have lead project teams in web redesigns
          and implementations. One of the larger, enterprise-level experiences I
          was involved with was leading a project team on the redesign of
          www.moneymanagement.org. I was accountable for all stages of the
          program beginning with product vision &amp; strategy (user journey
          mapping, personas, competitive metric analysis), project definition
          (budget, timeline, scope) to project design (wireframes, prototypes,
          design) then project execution (development and QA), and finally,
          project closing (post-mortem, launch, and internal training). The
          entire program consisted of three different projects: Overall site
          redesign, client DevOps enhancements, and CMS Analytics Strategy
          definition.
