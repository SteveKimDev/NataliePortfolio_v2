          This project was started as an ambitious business concept to bring
          Mexican wines to international tourists staying in private villas
          while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Many people visiting from
          outside of Mexico are often surprised to learn about Mexico’s fabulous
          wine country and its incredible wines. Using this web app, customers
          could select from 3 different tasting experiences - a basic wine &amp;
          cheese tasting, a more in-depth small bites &amp; wine tasting, or a
          full-blown 4-course wine pairing with a professional chef and
          sommelier. Customers would schedule their in-home tasting experience
          directly using the web app with the integrated Calendly appointment
          scheduling API.

            This was my first web project using Jamstack architecture and
            honestly where I fell in love with the concept as a whole. I had
            been studying React and working on a Progressive Web App when I
            started learning more about Jamstack and its benefits. Therefore
            this project was purposefully built with the Gatsby framework
            because I felt that Gatsby provided a good base with lots of
            existing plugins available and great documentation from which to
            start this project. Gatsby also works pretty seamlessly with
            Netlify, which I had also chosen as my deployment platform. I deploy
            nearly all my sites using Netlify because it is fast, secure and,
            super intuitive to use without having to worry about a bunch of
            deployment obstacles. I chose to use headless WordPress as my CMS
            for this project as I had been using monolithic WordPress previously
            and I was curious as to how it would work as a headless option.

          <p className={`mb-0rem`}>
            Headless WordPress is a whole other beast but I gained a lot of
            great experience customizing the content authoring experience using
            Advanced Custom Fields and creating Custom Post Types. I also dove
            further into database work and the webserver working with MySQL
            &amp; Apache using MAMP for local development. Deploying everything
            live on our hosting platform (for the CMS) and Netlify (for the
            frontend UI) was also a learning challenge that provided me valuable
            insights. This was also my first experience with GraphQL and that
            was a fairly steep learning curve. I dove into learning how GraphQL
            queries work and hence how to best organize my content. Overall this
            was a great project and I had a lot of fun working with the
            different APIs and frameworks.
