          Las Uvas Wine Tasting
        </h3>
        <p>
          Las Uvas Wine Tasting was a conceptual project built as a web app for
          users to schedule in-home wine tasting experiences. This web app was
          built from scratch using React, Gatsby, Calendly, headless WordPress,
          and Netlify. With this project, I obtained my first foray into GraphQL
          and working with headless CMS APIs along with using the Gatsby
          framework.
