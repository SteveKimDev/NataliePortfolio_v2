      I ARCHITECT MODERN DIGITAL EXPERIENCE SYSTEMS
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a young girl, I wanted to help build the cool, futuristic
      tech I saw in movies and on TV. Fast-forward years later - My background
      includes leading rock-star teams to produce amazing software products for
      Fortune 100 giants and bootstrapped start-ups alike. I focus on building
      mobile-first enterprise web systems and omnichannel digital experiences
      for growing companies. Iâ€™d love to see what I can help you with!
