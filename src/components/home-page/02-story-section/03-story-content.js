    <p>Attitude Is The Difference Between An Ordeal And An Adventure</p>
    <h2>True Story</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in leading multimillion-dollar enterprise digital experience
      implementations for billion-dollar companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I didn’t just land into this specialization overnight! It all
      started a couple of years after graduating college. I found myself sitting
      at a Seattle Starbucks thinking about the things I was naturally drawn to,
      contemplating what would make the most sense to me for my burgeoning
      career: I loved planning and organizing things, I loved creating and
      designing things, and I was fascinated by technology! A career in web
      development seemed like the perfect combination of all these passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My degree wasn’t in CS, but I submitted my resume to Microsoft anyway.
      I’ve always been the kind of relentlessly driven, ambitious person that
      has the audacity to reach for what others would deem unreachable. I just
      wanted to get my foot in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was nearly 20 years ago. Since then I've logged thousands of hours
      successfully leading software product releases at Microsoft and many other
      top-tier companies. As an Engineering Manager, Sr. Program Manager and,
      Agile Coach, I’ve spent years working with engineering teams and
      collaborating with marketers and senior leadership executives at all
      levels to produce customer-facing products that are used by millions of
      people every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve always had a passion for web development and technology. Today the
      web has ballooned into a network of APIs connecting purpose-built services
      allowing users to connect to your brand through a plethora of channels. My
      career plan, born at that Seattle Starbucks years ago, has taken me far
      and wide. Now, I architect, direct, and help build large-scale custom
      enterprise web systems that provide the agile flexibility needed to
      respond to the demands of today’s fast-growing businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to show you how I can help your business build a world-class
      digital customer experience!
