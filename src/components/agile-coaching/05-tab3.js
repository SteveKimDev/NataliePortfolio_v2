        Requirements definition as a team effort - avoiding silos. I encourage
        representatives from each discipline to be present at requirements
        definition and refinement. Each discipline has a unique voice and focus
        to offer that directly impacts the other. When Design, Quality, and
        Development all provide input it dramatically increases the team's
        understanding of feature goals, priorities, trade-offs, and risks.
