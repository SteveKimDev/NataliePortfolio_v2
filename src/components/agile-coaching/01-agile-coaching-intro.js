    <p>
      I’ve been an agile practitioner for 15 years, specializing in both Scrum
      and Kanban. I’ve had the privilege of working with many great teams in
      many different environments. I’ve even been featured on the Scrum Master
      Toolbox podcast with Vasco Duarte, author of #NoEstimates - a book that
      has had an enormously positive impact on my work. These experiences
      provided me with the opportunity to try new things and apply different
      approaches that honed my skills &amp; refined the systems and processes I
      use today.
